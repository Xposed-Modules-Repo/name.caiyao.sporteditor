# Xposed Modules Repo Example

You may only upload your own modules. If you have explicit permission from a developer to upload their module, it is fine as well, but both of you need to keep in mind that the uploader's name will be mentioned as author.
Obviously, modules must be compliant with the law and must not act in malicious ways. The operator of this site will not take any responsibility (or give support) for uploaded modules.

Only default branches will be processed.
